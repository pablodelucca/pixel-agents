# Ronald Next Steps (Simple)

You do **not** need to code.

## Right now
Nothing required from you.
Sam is preparing architecture first.

## Later (only when Sam asks)
You may need to do one of these:

1. **Run extension locally in VS Code**
   - Open the project folder
   - Press `F5`
   - Check if pixel characters change status correctly

2. **Confirm status behavior**
   - If an agent is clearly active but shown idle -> report it
   - If an agent is done but still shown waiting -> report it

3. **Optional UX preference**
   - Choose labels/colors/sounds you prefer for states

Sam will always give exact easy instructions before any of these.
